# **e-Vive** 
## **When Innovation meets Sustainability**

### **Problem Statement**

#### 1.The increasing levels of e-waste dumping without much reuse and recycling and use of new electronic products for minimal use. <br>

#### 2. The use of new electronic products for minimal use leading to creation of more electronic products and more e-waste.

### **Solutions**

#### 1.Discussion Forum- a platform for users to discuss ways on how the e-waste from various companies and households can be used to make new innovations<br>

#### 2. We also intend to reduce the manufacture of new electronic items for testing and research processes and reusing e-waste for the same. <br> 

#### 3. We plan on providing second-hand electronic items(often considered as e-waste by many) as reduced costs to encourage users to buy them instead of new items by creating an e-commerce platform.
